# MS_Synthetic_Library

Mass spectrometry over the last century represented superlative to analytical
methods with its unrivaled sensitivity and low detection limits. With increasing
storage capacity it is now possible to build huge spectral libraries based on MS
experiments performed in laboratories. However, spectral libraries do not cover all
currently known compounds due to physical limitations such as financial resources,
availability, and retrievability of compounds, etc. This problem calls for the creation
of *in silico* spectral libraries which will extend current libraries by covering blank
spaces in the reference library. The importance of such a task makes the creation of
a synthetic library from compound structural identifier, the new saint grail of
computational mass spectrometry. Currently, two methods tackling this need are
developed in Thermo Fisher Scientific. Your task will be to compare their
performance on test spectra.
